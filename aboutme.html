<p>Hi. Welcome to my website. I'm not entirely great at introductions so I'll just start, and we can go from there. I was born here, in New York City, and have been living here for 19 years. 
I am studying animation at BMCC to hopefully someday create beautiful 2D animation videos, shows, or even movies.
Drawing has been something ive been doing since I could practically hold a pencil, and now 19 years later, I'm still going strong.
I make an attempt to draw everyday. I also do some digital art, which can be seen in my Gallery, but i prefer traditional art. Good ol' paper and pencil.
I also play games. Super Smash Bros., Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. Basically anything that piques my interest.
Now, as for animation backup plans, so far I've got 1. I'd like to work for Laika Studios. The same people who did Coraline, Kubo and the 2 strings, Paranorman, and other movies. Just a simple stop-motion animation company.</p>
